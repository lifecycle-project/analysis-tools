# LifeCycle data 
Describes the data releases of the lifecycle data dictionaries.

## Data releases
In this repository we keep track of different versions of the LifeCycle data dictionary
> Please check: [version control of data dictionaries](dictionary/README.md).

### Generate fake data
You can also generate fake data based upon the different data dictionary versions that have been released.
That way you can check weather your Opal instance gives the correct result when querying it with DataSHIELD.
> Please check: [fake data generation](data-generator/README.md).
